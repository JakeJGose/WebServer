	<h1 class="title">Wolves are Very Cool</h1>
	<div class="paragraph1">
	<p>Wolves are objectively the best animals on the planet. This is an undisputed fact, and if you
think differently, then I have no time for you. They outrank bears, coyotes, lions, tigers, birds, sharks,
hippos, rhinoceroses, and even dodo birds and dinosaurs, because dodo birds and dinosaurs are dead, and wolves
are not. They can beat Neo from the Matrix in a fistfight, they act better than Mel Gibson, direct better than 
James Cameron, and they ask Samuel L. Jackson if he speaks English. "I have nightmares of wolves every night," recalls
the famous fighter Bruce Lee, days before his death. "Those things will probably kill me." Even John Cena has drawbacks 
when asked about these creatures. "Wolves? No comment," he'd say.</p>

<h1>Variations</h1>
There are many variations of wolves, and the two main are the Grey wolf and the Red wolf. The grey wolf, <em>Canis lupus</em>, is too cool
to follow rules, so they come in grey, white, brown and black. Red wolves, <em>Canis rufus</em>, are hardcore. Evidence shows that they paint themselves with the blood of enemy packs,
but they are so fast in their fights that there is no physical documentation. Multiple adventurers have been sent out to catch a picture, but they either do not come back or come back with
PTSD and other disorders. At the time of the dinosaurs, the Dire wolf, <em>Canis dirus</em>, ruled. Scientists previously said that they became "extinct," but empirical evidence shows otherwise. They 
obviously used the Murkuba to fly off into space, where they consumed all the Martians and continued their mission of galactic genocide, and the Illuminati was created by them to prepare earth species for eradication. 
Why else would we not have found life in space?

<h1>Presence In Media</h1>
Despite their immense power, installation of fear, and the fact that they have level 100 Sneak, wolves have become the subject of an uncountable amounts
of fan art. Adding keywords like "cool," "demon," etc. to "wolf" in the image search renders an insane number of interesting pictures. Some of these images are indeed
very odd, but this small number is not representative of the whole of these pictures. Below is a limited selection of fan art.
